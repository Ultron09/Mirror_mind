## 1. Universal Adaptation Benchmark (The "Omni-Test")

**File:** `universal_benchmark_results.png`
**Source Code:** `experiments/run_multi_model.py`

### 🎯 Experiment Goal

To prove that the **Meta-Controller** can adapt a single model to completely different data modalities (Text $\to$ Vision $\to$ Audio) sequentially, without catastrophic forgetting or manual retuning.

### 📊 Interpretation

* **Top Graph (Loss):** Shows the model's prediction error (Blue line) over time. Vertical dashed lines indicate a "Context Switch" where the data stream changes instantly from NLP (Text) to Computer Vision (Images) to Audio (Spectrograms).
  * *Observation:* At each boundary, the loss initially spikes (surprise), but quickly descends as the model adapts to the new modality.
* **Bottom Graph (Plasticity):** Displays the adaptive learning rate (Red line).
  * *Observation:* The "Stabilizer Reflex" is clearly visible. When the domain switches, the Meta-Controller detects high gradient variance/loss and instantly spikes the learning rate (Plasticity) to facilitate rapid relearning, then cools down as mastery is achieved.

### ✅ Key Takeaway

MirrorMind successfully demonstrates **domain-agnostic meta-learning**, capable of reconfiguring its weights for entirely different sensory inputs in real-time.

**Source Code:** `experiments/run_production.py`

### 🎯 Experiment Goal

To verify that a "Lazily Trained" (underfitted) model can be deployed to production and **improve over time** purely through interaction with live data, even when that data is noisy or shifting.

### 📊 Interpretation

* **Top Graph (Production Error):** The blue line represents prediction error during live inference.
  * *Observation:* Despite an initial high error (due to lazy training), the trend line (Red dashed) shows a consistent decrease. The model is "learning on the job."
* **Bottom Graph (Stabilizer Reflex):** The green line tracks the Learning Rate.
  * *Observation:* The spikes correspond to "Disturbance" events (e.g., noisy visual data). The framework automatically increases plasticity to compensate for the noise, stabilizing the model.

### ✅ Key Takeaway

**Lifelong Learning is viable.** The model successfully corrected its initial underfitting and adapted to noise without human intervention.

## 3. Extreme Stress Test (Multi-Stage Drift)

**File:** `proof_extreme.png`
**Source Code:** `experiments/run_experiment.py`

![1765194990306](image/Results/1765194990306.png)

### 🎯 Experiment Goal

To test the limits of the **Stabilizer System** by subjecting it to increasingly difficult concept drifts:

1. **Identity:** Output = Input (Easy)
2. **Negation:** Output = -Input (Pattern Reversal)
3. **Scramble:** Output = 2x + 1 (Distribution Shift)
4. **Chaos:** High Noise (Stress Test)

### 📊 Interpretation

* **Top Panel (Loss):** The Blue line shows the struggle at each boundary. Note the massive spike at step 200 (Negation) and 400 (Scramble).
* **Middle Panel (Adaptive LR):** The Red filled area shows the Meta-Controller's response.
  * *Observation:* During "Identity", LR is low (easy task). During "Scramble" and "Chaos", the LR saturates at the maximum allowed value, indicating the model is exerting maximum effort to adapt.
* **Bottom Panel (Introspection):** The Purple (Grad Norm) and Orange (Uncertainty) lines.
  * *Observation:* High uncertainty aligns perfectly with the "Chaos" phase, proving the introspection module correctly identifies low-confidence scenarios.

### ✅ Key Takeaway

The framework exhibits **robust recovery**. It survived radical shifts in logic (from copying to inverting to calculating) by dynamically allocating cognitive resources (Plasticity).

## 4. The Evolution Gap (Curriculum Learning)

**File:** `evolution_gap_v2.png` / `evolution_gap.png`
**Source Code:** `experiments/run_gap.py`

![1765195019127](image/Results/1765195019127.png)

### 🎯 Experiment Goal

To bridge the reasoning gap between smaller models (like GPT-2) and larger ones by using **Test-Time Training (TTT)** on a curriculum of math problems.

### 📊 Interpretation

* **Red Line (Evolved Accuracy):** Represents the model's ability to solve arithmetic problems.
* **Cyan Line (Task Difficulty):** The complexity of the math problems.
* **Yellow Dashed Line:** The target accuracy (GPT-3 baseline).
* *Observation:* As difficulty increases (Step 100), accuracy momentarily drops but then recovers and climbs. The model effectively "evolves" the capability to solve harder math problems by training on the test prompts for a few milliseconds before answering.

### ✅ Key Takeaway

**Plasticity beats Scale.** A smaller model with MirrorMind adaptation can achieve results comparable to larger static models on specific reasoning tasks.

## 5. Operation Overdrive (Instant Memorization)

**File:** `overdrive_results.png`
**Source Code:** `experiments/run_overdrive.py`

![1765195032091](image/Results/1765195032091.png)

### 🎯 Experiment Goal

To prove the capability of **Instant Knowledge Acquisition**. The model is given a random password in the prompt and must memorize it instantly to answer a subsequent query.

### 📊 Interpretation

* **Magenta Line (Success Rate):** 1.0 means perfect recall, 0.0 means failure.
* *Observation:* The graph shows sharp spikes reaching 1.0 immediately after new data is presented. This confirms that the Test-Time Training (TTT) loop effectively "injected" the random password into the model's weights in real-time.

### ✅ Key Takeaway

MirrorMind enables **Short-Term Weight Memory**, allowing models to memorize arbitrary data (like secrets or context) instantly without a context window limitation.

## 6. ARC-AGI Benchmark

**File:** `enhanced_dashboard.png`
**Source Code:** `experiments/run_arc_gpt2.py`

![1765195290320](image/Results/1765195290320.png)

### 🎯 Experiment Goal

To evaluate general intelligence using the **ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus)** dataset, utilizing a modern, multi-metric dashboard to visualize performance in real-time.

### 📊 Interpretation

* **Loss Trajectory:** Compares the loss curves of the Base Model (Red) vs. MirrorMind (Green), providing a clear view of stability and convergence differences across tasks.
* **Performance Improvement:** A bar chart visualizes the percentage improvement per task (Green = Win, Red = Loss), highlighting specific logical puzzles where adaptation provided a decisive advantage.
* **Cumulative Win Rate:** Tracks the percentage of tasks where MirrorMind outperformed the static baseline, offering a high-level metric of success.
* **Distribution & Rolling Avg:** Statistical plots (Histogram and Rolling Average) reveal the consistency of the improvements and filter out noise from individual task difficulty spikes.

### ✅ Key Takeaway

**Few-Shot Adaptation works.** Optimizing on the few examples provided in an ARC task significantly improves performance compared to standard context-based few-shot learning, as evidenced by the sustained win rate and positive rolling improvement average.
