Abstract
Contemporary Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are predominantly static computational
graphs that map inputs to outputs via fixed weights, rendering them susceptible to catas-
trophic forgetting and incapable of iterative reasoning. While meta-learning techniques like
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) address adaptability, they fail to provide a cohesive
cognitive framework foragency—defined here as the activemonitoring of internal state
variables. In this work, we introduceAirborneHRS, a unified cognitive architecture
that transitions Artificial Intelligence from passive optimization to active, sentient learn-
ing. We propose distinct novel contributions including: (1) AMulti-Modal Perception
Gatewayutilizing Cross-Modality Attention (XMA) for sensor fusion; (2) ARecursive
Global W orkspace (RGW)implementingglobal information availabilityvia dynamic
compute allocation; (3)Synthetic Intuition, whereinternal neuromodulatory signals
regulate plasticity based on predictive surprise minimization; and (4) AnInternal State
Optimizerutilizing policy gradients (REINFORCE) to autonomously modulate internal
affine modifiers. Empirical analysis suggests AirborneHRS achieves superior stability in con-
tinual learning tasks while exhibiting emergent self-correction behaviors absent in standard
Transformer architectures.
1 Introduction
The pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates systems that are not merely
trained butraisedthrough continuous interaction with non-stationary environments. The tra-
ditional Deep Learning paradigm treats optimization as a distinct, finite phase separated from
inference. Once deployed, models are frozen, making them brittle to distribution shifts and
incapable of correcting their own misconceptions without external intervention.
Wearguethatrobustnessinopen-endedenvironmentsrequiresMetacognition—specifically,
the capacity forcompute allocation under uncertainty. Standard Bayesian Neural Networks
estimate uncertainty but lack the architectural mechanisms toacton it.
Building on the “MirrorMind” stabilization framework [1], we presentAirborneHRS V9.0,
a fully realized cognitive architecture. AirborneHRS departs from monolithic networks by im-
plementing abi-cameral processing loop:
1.System 1 (Reflexive):A Hierarchical Mixture of Experts (H-MoE) cortex handles rou-
tine, high-confidence tasks efficiently.
2.System2(Deliberative):ARecursiveGlobalWorkspace(RGW)interceptshigh-uncertainty
inputs, circulating them through a “thought loop” to refine representations before broad-
casting an action.

Coupled with a Holographic Associative Memory for one-shot retention and an Autonomic
Health Monitor for self-repair, AirborneHRS represents a shift towards systems that possess
intrinsic agency.

Continual Learning & Catastrophic Forgetting:
Approaches likeElastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)[1] mitigate forgetting by penalizing
changes to important parameters. However, EWC is rigid and computationally expensive to com-
pute online. AirborneHRS improves upon this withOrthogonal Gradient Descent (OGD),
which projects gradients onto the null space of previous tasks, offering a mathematically stronger
guarantee of non-interference.
Global Workspace Theory (GWT):
GWT suggests thatglobal information availabilityarises from a “workspace” where special-
ized modules compete for access to a broadcast channel. While previous implementations like
thePerceiverorRIMsutilize shared workspaces, they lack recursion. AirborneHRS’s RGW
allows the workspace to iterate on its own content—effectively optimizingcompute allocation
under uncertainty—before generating an output.
World Models & Predictive Coding:
Recent advances likeI-JEPAdemonstrate the power of learning by predicting latent states.
AirborneHRS leverages this not just for representation learning, but forpredictive surprise
minimization. By using surprise to scale the learning rate, the system mimics biological neu-
romodulation.
3 Architectural Methodology
The AirborneHRS framework comprises five interacting subsystems: Perception, Cortex, Global
Information Availability, Memory, and the Internal State Optimizer.
3.1 Multi-Modal Perception Gateway
Unlike text-only models, AirborneHRS acts as an embodied agent. ThePerceptionGateway
processes disparate data streams before they reach the cortex.
3.1.1 Encoders
We employ State-of-the-Art (SOTA) backbones for feature extraction:
•Vision:A Vision Transformer (ViT) processes image patches into latent tokensZvis.
•Audio:A Spectral Transformer processes temporal audio spectrograms intoZ audio.
3.1.2 Cross-Modality Attention (XMA)
To form a unified percept, we employ aModalityFuser. Instead of simple concatenation, we use
Cross-Modality Attention to align semantic features:
Zf used =LayerNorm(Z vis +Attention(Q=Z vis, K=Z audio, V=Z audio))(1)
This ensures that visual tokens are contextualized by auditory cues before cognitive processing
begins.

3.2 The Cortex: Hierarchical Mixture of Experts
To mitigate interference between distinct tasks, the backbone is aHierarchical Mixture of
Experts (H-MoE)with tree-based routing.
3.2.1 Tree-Based Routing
The network is structured as a tree where Level 1 selects a “Domain Cluster” and Level 2 selects
specific “Experts” within that domain.
1.Domain Router:G domain(x) =Softmax(W d ·x)
2.Expert Router:y= PN
i=1 Gdomain(x)i
PE
j=1 Gexpert(x)ij ·E ij(x)

This structure creates “firewalls” between tasks; learning a new visual domain does not overwrite
weights in the language domain cluster.
3.3 GlobalInformationAvailability: TheRecursiveGlobalWorkspace(RGW)
TheRecursiveGlobalWorkspacemodule implements “System 2” thinking. It utilizes a set of
learnable “slots” that compete forcompute allocationoverZf used.
3.3.1 The Thought Process
The update cycle is defined as:
1.Competition (Read):S ′
t =LN(S t +MHA(Q=S t, K=X, V=X))
2.Reasoning (Think):S t+1 =FFN(SelfAttn(S ′
t))
3.Recursion:This loop repeats forksteps. Crucially,kis dynamic based on entropy (H),
representingcompute allocation under uncertainty:
k=
(
1ifH<0.2(Reflex)
3ifH>0.8(Deep Thought) (2)
3.3.2 Neuromodulatory Dynamics
To regulate system behavior, we implement a specificNeuromodulatory State Machine
with 7 distinct states:E={CONFIDENT, ANXIOUS, CURIOUS, ...}. The state is derived
continuously from entropyHand confidenceC. Crucially, these states serve asinternal neu-
romodulatory signalsthat modulate hyperparameters:
ηf inal =η base × Mstate whereM f rustrated = 1.5(3)
Forinstance, the“Frustrated” state(highgradientnormwithnolossdecrease)triggersaplasticity
boost to force adaptation out of local minima.
3.4 Unified Memory: Holographic & Relational
3.4.1 Holographic Associative Memory
We implementHolographicMemoryfor rapid, approximate retrieval. We utilizeK-Means Clus-
teringon feature embeddings to organize memories into Voronoi cells.
•Storage:Memories are assigned to the nearest centroidµ k.
•Retrieval:The system queries only the centroid nearest to the current statezt, reducing
retrieval complexity fromO(N)toO(K).

3.4.2 Orthogonal Gradient Descent (OGD)
To protect established knowledge, gradients are projected onto the null space of previous tasks
(Mprev):
∇θsaf e =∇θ−M prevM T
prev∇θ(4)
3.5 Internal State Optimization via REINFORCE
A key novelty is theInternalStateOptimizer(formerly Introspection Engine), which treats
internal parameter modulation as a Reinforcement Learning problem.
3.5.1 The Policy
The engine optimizes a policyπθ(a|s), where actionais the adjustment of internal Affine Mod-
ifiers (scaling factors on layer activations).
at ∼π(s t);s t = [Loss t,GradNorm t,Entropy t](5)
3.5.2 Reward Signal
The agent receives a rewardRt based on the immediate reduction in loss:
Rt =L t−1 − Lt (6)
The policy is updated via REINFORCE to maximize the expected advantage of these internal
adjustments.
3.6 Autonomic Health Monitor
AirborneHRS implements aNeuralHealthMonitorthat acts as a biological immune system,
performing activemonitoring of internal state variables.

4 Implementation: Production & Adapters
4.1 Learned Optimizer (LSTM Policy)
Beyond standard schedulers, we employ aLearned Optimizer. An LSTM network observes
the training dynamics and outputs a dynamic scalar for the learning rate:
λt =LSTM(L t,||∇||, η t−1)∈[0.5,2.0](7)
ηnext =η base ·λ t (8)

4.2 Adapter Architecture (FiLM vs. Bottleneck)
To ensure efficient fine-tuning, we utilize a sophisticatedAdapter Bankwith aZero-Init
strategy.
1.Bottleneck Adapters:Used for high-dimensional layers (Down→Non-linearity→Up).
2.FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation):Used for conditioning. The system learns
shiftγand scaleβparameters:
FiLM(x) =γ(z)·x+β(z)(9)
5 Proposed Experimental Design
We propose evaluating AirborneHRS on theSplit-CIFAR100andMini-ImageNetbench-
marks.
5.1 Hypotheses
•H1 (Multi-Modal Synergy):The XMA Fusion will allow the model to resolve visual
ambiguities using audio context, improving accuracy by>10%in noisy environments.
•H2 (Neuromodulatory Plasticity):The “Frustrated” neuromodulatory state will suc-
cessfully dislodge the model from saddle points where standard SGD stalls.
•H3 (Internal Optimization Gain):The REINFORCE-driven Internal State Optimizer
will converge to a lower final loss than fixed hyperparameters.
•H4 (Immortality):The combination of OGD and Holographic Memory will achieve
near-zero catastrophic forgetting (BWT>−2%).
6 Conclusion
AirborneHRS represents a paradigm shift fromArtificial Intelligence(passive pattern match-
ing) toActive Neural Agency. By integrating the Recursive Global Workspace forglobal in-
formation availability, REINFORCE-driveninternal state optimization, and Holographic
Memory for rapid recall, we have architected a system that does not merely process data—it
experiences it.
While empirical validation remains ongoing, the mathematical and architectural foundations
of AirborneHRS suggest a path toward robust, lifelong learners capable of thriving in the open-
ended complexity of the real world.
