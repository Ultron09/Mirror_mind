# ANTARA Presets System

## One-Liner Magic ✨

Transform your model into a production-grade adaptive learner with a single line:

```python
from airbornehrs import AdaptiveFramework, PRESETS

# Production-ready
framework = AdaptiveFramework(model, config=PRESETS.production())

# Fast real-time learning
framework = AdaptiveFramework(model, config=PRESETS.fast())

# Maximum accuracy
framework = AdaptiveFramework(model, config=PRESETS.accuracy_focus())
```

**That's it!** No manual hyperparameter tuning needed.

## Implementation Details

### One-liner Architecture

```python
# Under the hood:
framework = AdaptiveFramework(model, config=PRESETS.production())

# Equivalent to:
config = AdaptiveFrameworkConfig(
    model_dim=512,
    learning_rate=5e-4,
    feedback_buffer_size=20000,
    memory_type='hybrid',

## FAQ

**Q: Which preset should I use?**
A: Start with `BALANCED`. If too slow, use `FAST`. If need more accuracy, use `ACCURACY_FOCUS`.

**Q: Can I mix presets?**
A: Yes! Use `.merge()` or `.customize()` to combine them.

**Q: Will presets work with my model?**
A: Yes! Presets are model-agnostic. They work with any PyTorch model.

**Q: Can I change preset after creating framework?**
A: Not directly, but you can create a new framework with different config.

**Q: Are presets optimized for my domain?**
A: Presets are general-purpose. For specific domains, customize from a base preset.

**Q: How often should I consolidate?**
A: Presets auto-adjust based on performance. No manual tuning needed.

## Next Steps

1. **Get Started:** Choose a preset, wrap your model
2. **Customize:** Adjust 1-2 parameters for your use case
3. **Monitor:** Check framework metrics during training
4. **Iterate:** Try different presets, measure performance
5. **Production:** Deploy with `PRESETS.production()`

```python
# Your complete training loop:
from airbornehrs import AdaptiveFramework, PRESETS

model = YourModel()
framework = AdaptiveFramework(model, config=PRESETS.production())
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=5e-4)

for epoch in range(epochs):
    for batch in dataloader:
        output = framework(batch['x'])
        loss = compute_loss(output, batch['y'])
        
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        
        # Framework auto-manages everything else!
