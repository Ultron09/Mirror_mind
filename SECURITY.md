## Reporting a Vulnerability

We encourage **responsible disclosure** of security vulnerabilities.

### ✅ How to Report

Please report vulnerabilities **privately** via email:

**📧 security@airbornehrs.com**  
(Replace with your official security inbox if different)

**Do NOT** open public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests for
security-sensitive findings.

### 📄 What to Include

To help us evaluate your report quickly, please include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Affected version(s)
- Reproduction steps or proof-of-concept (PoC)
- Potential impact (data exposure, RCE, privilege escalation, etc.)
- Any suggested mitigation (optional but appreciated)

Incomplete reports may take longer to triage.

---

### ⏱ Response Timeline

We aim to follow this timeline:

- **Acknowledgement:** within **48 hours**
- **Initial assessment:** within **5 business days**
- **Status updates:** every **7–10 days** until resolution

Complex issues may require additional time, but we will keep you informed.

### 🧠 Disclosure Process

If a vulnerability is **accepted**:
- We will work on a fix or mitigation
- A coordinated disclosure timeline will be agreed upon
- Credit may be given (optional, at your request)

If a vulnerability is **declined**:
- We will provide a clear technical explanation
- False positives or expected behaviors will be documented

## Scope

### ✅ In Scope
- Authentication & authorization flaws
- Data leaks or privacy violations
- Remote code execution
- Dependency vulnerabilities affecting runtime security
- Model misuse leading to security compromise (if applicable)

### ❌ Out of Scope
- Denial-of-service via excessive traffic
- Social engineering or phishing
- Issues in unsupported versions
- Non-security bugs or feature requests
- Vulnerabilities requiring physical access

## Safe Harbor

We support **good-faith security research**.

If you:
- Follow this policy
- Avoid data destruction or service disruption
- Do not publicly disclose without coordination

We will **not pursue legal action** against you.
