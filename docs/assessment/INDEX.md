### The Main Gaps
1. **No Jupyter notebooks** (-1.0 points)
   - Users can't learn by doing
   - Highest friction point
   - **Easiest to fix**

2. **High inference overhead** (-0.8 points)
   - 15% overhead kills production use
   - Enterprise requirement is <5%
   - **Requires optimization work**

3. **No published benchmarks** (-0.8 points)
   - Users don't know when to use MirrorMind
   - No competitive comparison
   - **Takes experimental setup**

4. **Zero community/visibility** (-0.5 points)
   - <100 GitHub stars
   - Nobody knows you exist
   - **Requires marketing effort**

### The Quick Wins
- Tier 1 gives you **50% of your gains** (1.2 / 2.6 points)
- Takes only **16 hours** (2 weeks part-time)
- Gets you to **8.6/10**
- Makes your framework **immediately usable**

### The ROI
```
Time spent    vs    Points gained    =    ROI
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Tier 1: 16h        +1.2 points       0.075 pts/h
Tier 2: 20h        +0.6 points       0.030 pts/h
Tier 3: 55h        +0.5 points       0.009 pts/h

## 📞 QUESTIONS?

### Q: Which document should I read first?
**A:** Start with `PACKAGE_IMPROVEMENT_SUMMARY.md` (5 min overview)

### Q: Which task should I do first?
**A:** Create quickstart Jupyter notebook (highest impact per hour)

### Q: How long will it take to hit 10/10?
**A:** 
- Fast track (Tiers 1+2): 8 weeks for 9.2/10 ✅ Recommended
- Complete (All tiers): 26 weeks for 10.0/10

### Q: What if I don't have time?
**A:** Do Tier 1 only (2 weeks, 16 hours) → Get to 8.6/10
This gets you most of the important gains.

### Q: Can I skip any tiers?
**A:**
