# Synthetic Intuition: The V2.0.0 Architecture

AirborneHRS V2.0.0 represents a paradigm shift from **Reactive AI** (Output = f(Input)) to **Predictive AI** (Output = f(Input, Predicted_Future)).

This document details the five pillars of this architecture.

## 0. THE SENSORIUM (Multi-Modal Encoders)
**[Technical Deep Dive: Multi-Modal Fusion ↗](../math/MULTIMODAL_FUSION.md)**

Before synthetic intuition can operate, the system must perceive. AirborneHRS V2.0.0 replaces standard input layers with a modular **Perception Gateway**.

### A. Vision (ViT-Based)
The system processes visual streams using a Patch-Based Transformer.
-   **Method**: Images are sliced into $16 \times 16$ patches.
-   **Projection**: Patches are linearly projected into the model dimension $D$.
-   **Learned Positional Embeddings**: Spatial context is injected via learnable parameters.

### B. Audio (Spectral-Transformer)
Audio is not treated as a naive waveform but as a temporal sequence of spectral features.
-   **Method**: STFT Spectrogram $\rightarrow$ Linear Projection.
-   **Temporal Attention**: A causal Transformer encodes dependencies over time (e.g., speech phonemes or rhythm).

### C. The Fusion Layer (XMA)
All modalities are unified in a single manifold via **Cross-Modality Attention**. We append learnable "Modality Tokens" (VisionToken, AudioToken) to each stream, allowing the model to dynamically attend to "Sound" or "Sight" based on context.

## 1. The World Model (I-JEPA Implementation)

The core of "Synthetic Intuition" is the ability to forecast the consequences of actions or the evolution of the environment without external labels. We implement a **Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (I-JEPA)** based on LeCun's vision for AGI.

### How it Works
1.  **Context Encoder**: The model observes the current state $x_t$ and encodes it into a latent representation $s_t$.
2.  **Predictor**: A specialized network takes $s_t$ and a potential action $a_t$ (or simple time step $\Delta t$) and predicts the *future latent state* $\hat{s}_{t+1}$.
3.  **Target Encoder**: The model later observes the actual next state $x_{t+1}$ and encodes it into $s_{t+1}$.
4.  **Surprise ($S$)**: The system computes the distance between prediction and reality:
    $$ S = || \hat{s}_{t+1} - s_{t+1} ||^2 $$

### The "Intuition" Signal
The $S$ term (Surprise) acts as an intrinsic loss function.
-   **Low Surprise**: The agent "understands" the physics of the environment.
-   **High Surprise**: The agent is confused or encountering a novelty.

AirborneHRS minimizes $S$ via gradient descent *simultaneously* with the main task loss. This forces the model to learn causal structures, not just statistical correlations.

## 2. Hierarchical Mixture of Experts (H-MoE)

To scale capacity without scaling compute, V2.0.0 treats the neural network not as a single block, but as a **Fractal Grid of Experts**.

### Routing Hierarchy
1.  **Level 1: Domain Router**:
    -   Classifies the input modality or high-level context (e.g., "Is this Vision?" "Is this Audio?").
    -   Routes the signal to a specific **Domain Cluster**.

2.  **Level 2: Expert Router**:
    -   Inside a Domain Cluster, a second router selects the Top-K (usually K=2) specific expert networks (MLPs) best suited for the specific pattern (e.g., "Vertical Edges expert" vs "Color Gradient expert").

### Mathematical Benefit
$$ \text{Total Parameters} \approx N \times M $$
$$ \text{Active Parameters} \approx \text{TopK} $$
Where $N$ is number of experts and $M$ is expert size.
This allows us to increase $N$ to thousands (trillion-parameter scale) while inference cost remains constant ($\approx 2$ active blocks).

## 3. Relational Graph Memory

Standard memory buffers (Experience Replay) are unstructured lists. V2.0.0 uses a **Semantic Graph**.

### Structure
-   **Nodes**: Events or Snapshots $E_i$ containing state vectors $z_i$.
-   **Edges**: Semantic links based on cosine similarity $\text{sim}(z_i, z_j)$.

$$ \text{Edge}_{ij} = \mathbb{I}(\text{sim}(z_i, z_j) > \tau) $$

### Retrieval Process
When the agent encounters a current state $z_t$:
1.  It broadcasts $z_t$ to the graph.
2.  It activates nodes with high similarity.
3.  **Spreading Activation**: Activation flows across Edges to related concepts.
4.  **Context Infusion**: The aggregated memory is added to the model context.

This mimics biological **Associative Memory**.

## 4. Neural Health Monitor (Autonomic Repair)

Deep production models often suffer from "Silent Failures" like Dead Neurons (ReLU death) or Gradient Explosions.

### The Watchdog Loop
The `NeuralHealthMonitor` runs as a sidecar process:
1.  **Probe**: Checks activation statistics $\mu, \sigma$ of every layer.
2.  **Diagnose**:
    -   If $\text{count}(activations=0) > 95\%$: **DEAD NEURON SYNDROME**.
    -   If $\text{norm}(grad) > \text{threshold}$: **GRADIENT EXPLOSION**.
3.  **Repair**:
    -   **Re-initialization**: Resets the weights of dead neurons to random values to give them a "second chance."
    -   **Gradient Clipping**: Dynamically clamps gradients.
    -   **LR Adaptation**: Lowers learning rate if instability is detected.

This makes AirborneHRS V2.0.0 effectively "crash-proof" in long-running scenarios.
