# 🧠 MIRRORMIND
## A System-Level Evaluation Protocol for Continuous Learning

**Integrity · Adaptivity · Universality · Behavior · Performance · Stability**

---

## 🧩 Why This Exists

> **Static models fail reality.**  
> MirrorMind is designed to *live*, *adapt*, and *survive drift*.

This protocol answers one brutal question:

> **Is MirrorMind a real continuous learning system — or just training wrapped in abstraction?**

---

## ⚙️ PHASE 1 — SYSTEM INTEGRITY (Smoke Test)

**File:** `phase1_integrity.py`

**Goal:** Ensure the system installs, imports, and runs without crashing.

**Pass Condition:**
```
Exit Code: 0
Log: "System Stable"
```

---

## 🧠 PHASE 2 — FUNCTIONAL VERIFICATION

**File:** `phase2_verification.py`

**Checks:**
- Weights must change (L2 norm > 0)
- Fisher matrix must be populated
- Learning rate must adapt

---

## 🌐 PHASE 3 — UNIVERSAL COMPATIBILITY

**File:** `phase3_universal.py`

Tested architectures:
- CNN (Vision)
- LSTM/GRU (Sequence)
- Transformer/MLP (Symbolic)

**Pass Condition:** Loss decreases for all models.

---

## ⚡ PHASE 4 — BEHAVIORAL DYNAMICS

**File:** `phase4_behavior.py`

**Signals:**
- Surprise Z-score spike > 3
- Learning-rate reflex
- Loss recovery

---

## 🧩 PHASE 5 — ARC-AGI BENCHMARK

**File:** `phase5_arc_benchmark.py`

**Pass Condition:**
```
Accuracy(MirrorMind) > Accuracy(Frozen Model)
```

---

## 🧬 PHASE 6 — THE TITAN PROTOCOL

**File:** `phase6_titan_seal.py`

**Task:** Mackey–Glass Chaotic Time-Series

**Metrics:**
- Faster stabilization
- Stable gradients
- No catastrophic forgetting

---

## 🏁 FINAL VERDICT

> If all six phases pass without hacks or resets,  
> **MirrorMind qualifies as a true continuous learning system.**

Not a wrapper.  
Not a trick.  
**A living model.**
